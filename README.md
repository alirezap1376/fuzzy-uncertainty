When dealing with fuzzy uncertainty, various models have been proposed so far. Among these approaches are models such as RPP1, RPP2, and RPP3, as well as the SoftWorstCase and HardWorstCase scenarios. 
In the codes below, each of these models has been implemented for the well-known lumber supply problem, and the behavior of these models has been examined by simulating the uncertain parameters. 
The simultaneous examination of the codes can be found in the file Analysis.py.
